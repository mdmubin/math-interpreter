# Java Math Interpreter

This is my attempt to create a version of [David Callanan's](https://github.com/davidcallanan) own interpreter that can be found [here](https://github.com/davidcallanan/py-simple-math-interpreter).

A math interpreter that can evaluate simple arithmetic expressions, written from scratch in Java.

### Tested on OpenJDK 11
